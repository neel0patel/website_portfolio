            <h3>A Few Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
              During my immersive and hands-on experience at my professional
              software developer boootcamp, I was able to accomplish several
              feats in which all required time, effort, knowledge and research.
              Shown below are just a few of my most recognizable accomplishments
              during my bootcamp.

                  <h4>Browser Game</h4>
                  <p>
                    The objective of this project was to develop a fully
                    functional browser game with meticulous attention to its
                    specifications and design. To accomplish this, I utilized
                    HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript in the creation of the game.
                    As a solo project, I assumed responsibility for every
                    aspect, including conceptualization, design, and
                    troubleshooting. By focusing solely on the front-end, I
                    addressed and resolved any issues that arose during the
                    development process, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable
                    gaming experience for users.

                  <h4>Recipe Application</h4>
                  <p>
                    I collaborated with a team of five individuals to develop a
                    recipe application focused on storing recipes in an online
                    database. To streamline our workflow, we divided the group
                    into front-end (FE) and back-end (BE) development teams.
                    Throughout the project, we maintained consistent
                    communication to ensure everyone was aligned and all code
                    was functioning properly. Our primary objective for this
                    application was to enable users to effortlessly add, save,
                    edit, and delete recipes, providing a seamless recipe
                    management experience.

                  <h4>Task Management Tool</h4>
                  <p>
                    This project was a result of my individual effort, where I
                    focused on authenticity, functionality, and robust data
                    management to deliver an exceptional user experience. By
                    recreating the "Things" application for my final project
                    with NJIT, I incorporated JS, React, and Shell in both the
                    front-end and back-end development. This comprehensive
                    approach allowed for seamless creation, editing, and
                    deletion of daily tasks. Leveraging mongoDB, I efficiently
                    stored tasks and user data while ensuring secure collection
                    and encryption with "passport.js." By integrating "jwt," I
                    enhanced security by generating hashed passwords during user
                    registration. Overall, my project represents a culmination
                    of my skills and dedication, aiming to provide an optimal
                    user experience.
